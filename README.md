# Performant Node Package Manager (PNPM)

In simple terms, **PNPM (Performant NPM)** is a forward-thinking package management solution designed to address the challenges posed by traditional package managers. At its core, PNPM employs a centralized storage system combined with hard links to streamline the way dependencies are managed in JavaScript projects. Unlike NPM and Yarn, which tend to duplicate packages for each project, PNPM utilizes a content-addressable store to create hard links to packages from the virtual store, drastically reducing redundancy and disk space consumption. 5 Oct 2023
